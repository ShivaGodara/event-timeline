# Event Timeline

## Stage 1 - Basic Structure

This project aims to visualize events along a timeline.

### Stage 1 Goals:
- Set up the base HTML structure.
- Include a semantic layout using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`.
- Add a logo and a theme toggle in the header.
- Create an empty `#timeline` section where event markers will appear.
- Add an empty `<div id="modal">` for future pop-up dialogs or overlays.
- Use semantic tags such as `<article>` and `<figure>` as needed in future iterations.
